# ArduinoTutorials
Intended to document my progress of learning about Arduino projects, micro-controllers, single board computers, robotics, sensors and basic automation.

# Hierarchy of files

## Arduino
### All the projects in 'Projects/' are based on the two works of the books referenced in root.
### There is also a personal notebook (latex files may be included) where I write everything I learn (Since this is not an official book of any kind, don't believe anything you read there, it might be wrong).

## RaspberryPi
NO WORK ON SINGLE BOARD COMPUTERS YET.
